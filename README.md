## TypeScript (ESM) usage

This repository is configured for modern TypeScript with ESM (NodeNext).

- Build: `npm run build` (outputs to `dist/`)
- Dev (run source files directly with tsx): `npm run dev`
- Start built output: `npm run start`

After editing, run `npm install` to install dev dependencies (typescript, ts-node, @types/node) if you haven't already.
